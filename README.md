# ðŸ“š LibraSys â€“ Library Management System

A **JavaFX-based Library Management System** developed for the **Software Design & Analysis (SDA)** course in Semester 5.  
It follows **MVC architecture** and integrates with a **MySQL database** to manage books, members, loans, and reservations.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **User Roles**: Admin, Librarian, Member
- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and view books
- **Member Management**: Register and manage members
- **Loan & Return System**: Issue and return books with due date tracking
- **Reservation System**: Reserve and manage book reservations
- **Reports**: Generate detailed library reports
- **Authentication**: Secure login system
- **Database Integration**: MySQL backend with triggers and constraints
- **Interactive UI**: Built using JavaFX and FXML
